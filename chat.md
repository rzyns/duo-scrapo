rzyns: Regarding Python typing: I know that Python does not yet support intersection types, but there has to be a way to achieve something similar. Specifically, if I have a function which takes an argument named `a` which needs to satisfy both the `Iterable` and `Buffer` protocols, how would I express that type?

GitHub Copilot: To express a type that satisfies both the [`Iterable`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `Buffer` protocols in Python, you can use a combination of [`typing`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `typing_extensions` modules. The `typing_extensions` module provides a `Protocol` class that allows you to define custom protocols. 

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Define custom protocols for [`Iterable`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `Buffer`.
2. Create a new protocol that inherits from both [`Iterable`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `Buffer`.
3. Use this new protocol as the type hint for your function argument.

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. Import necessary modules from [`typing`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `typing_extensions`.
2. Define the `Buffer` protocol.
3. Define a new protocol that inherits from both [`Iterable`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `Buffer`.
4. Use this new protocol as the type hint for the function argument.

### Code Implementation

```python
# Generated by Copilot

from typing import Protocol, Iterable
from typing_extensions import Protocol

class Buffer(Protocol):
    def read(self) -> bytes:
        ...

class IterableBuffer(Iterable, Buffer, Protocol):
    ...

def process_data(a: IterableBuffer) -> None:
    # Function implementation here
    pass
```

In this code:
- `Buffer` is a custom protocol that requires a `read` method returning `bytes`.
- `IterableBuffer` is a new protocol that inherits from both [`Iterable`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `Buffer`.
- `process_data` is a function that takes an argument `a` which must satisfy both [`Iterable`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%222f98b62f-e097-4d05-bd01-ae75245717a3%22%5D "Go to definition") and `Buffer` protocols.

rzyns: Perfect, thank you!

GitHub Copilot: You're welcome! If you need any further assistance, feel free to ask.

rzyns: Now, at the end of the current file, I have placed in comments the data I've generated from Morfeusz for the Polish verb "mówić". I'm trying to figure out what all the tags mean. Can you figure out what the tags "ger", "pacta", "ppas", "pcon", and "sec" mean?

GitHub Copilot: To understand the tags used by Morfeusz for Polish verbs, you can refer to the official documentation or linguistic resources. Here are the meanings of the specific tags you mentioned:

1. **ger**: Gerund (gerundium) - a verbal noun.
2. **pacta**: Active participle (participium activum).
3. **ppas**: Passive participle (participium passivum).
4. **pcon**: Conjunctive participle (participium coniunctivum).
5. **sec**: Secondary form (used in some specific grammatical contexts).

These tags are part of the morphological analysis provided by Morfeusz, which helps in understanding the grammatical properties of words.

If you need further assistance with the tags or any other aspect of your project, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Oh perfect! Thank you! What about "pact" vs. "pacta"?

GitHub Copilot: In the context of Morfeusz and Polish linguistic terminology:

- **pact**: Active participle (participium activum).
- **pacta**: Active adjectival participle (participium activum adjectivum).

The difference lies in the specific grammatical role and usage of the participle. The "pacta" form is more specific and is used in adjectival contexts.

If you need further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Ahh great, thanks! Now how about "aff"?

GitHub Copilot: In the context of Morfeusz and Polish linguistic terminology:

- **aff**: Affirmative (indicating that the verb form is in the affirmative mood).

This tag is used to specify that the verb form is not negated.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Great, that's perfect! Thank you so much!

GitHub Copilot: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding!

rzyns: What are some other common tags used by Morfeusz for Polish verb forms?

GitHub Copilot: Morfeusz uses a variety of tags to describe the morphological properties of Polish verb forms. Here are some common tags you might encounter:

1. **fin**: Finite verb form (indicative, imperative, conditional).
2. **praet**: Past tense.
3. **impt**: Imperative mood.
4. **imps**: Impersonal form.
5. **inf**: Infinitive.
6. **pcon**: Conjunctive participle.
7. **pant**: Active adjectival participle.
8. **ppas**: Passive participle.
9. **ger**: Gerund.
10. **bedzie**: Future tense (analytic form with "będzie").
11. **aglt**: Agglutinated form (e.g., clitics).
12. **winien**: Modal verb "winien" (should, ought to).

These tags help in identifying the specific grammatical forms and functions of verbs in Polish.

If you need further assistance or have more questions, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Wonderful, thank you! Now, in the current file I've started to sketch out a Python representation of the Morpheusz interpretations produced by `generate()` and `analyse()`. Could you please help me flesh this out a bit into a cohesive, sensible class structure?

GitHub Copilot: Sure! Let's build a cohesive class structure to represent the Morfeusz interpretations produced by `generate()` and `analyse()`. We'll create classes to represent the data structure and include methods to handle the data appropriately.

### Plan

1. **Define the [`Data`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%22056dba77-df77-4d53-8682-8797c9711809%22%5D "Go to definition") and [`Interp`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%22056dba77-df77-4d53-8682-8797c9711809%22%5D "Go to definition") types**.
2. **Create a [`Word`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22056dba77-df77-4d53-8682-8797c9711809%22%5D "Go to definition") class** to represent individual words with their attributes.
3. **Create a `Morpheme` class** to represent morphemes with their attributes.
4. **Create a `MorphologicalAnalysis` class** to handle the results from `generate()` and `analyse()` methods.

4. **`MorphologicalAnalysis` Class**: Handles the results from `generate()` and `analyse()` methods of the [`Morfeusz`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22056dba77-df77-4d53-8682-8797c9711809%22%5D "Go to definition") library. It includes methods to analyze text and generate morphemes.

This structure should provide a cohesive and sensible representation of the Morfeusz interpretations.

rzyns: OK, thanks! Now, in the terminal output, there are a bunch of results from Morfeusz's `generate()` function which have things like "on:S" and "mat:Sm1" in the analysis. What do these mean?

GitHub Copilot: The results from Morfeusz's `generate()` function include morphological tags that provide information about the grammatical properties of the words. Here's a breakdown of the tags you mentioned:

1. **on:S**:
   - **on**: The lemma or base form of the word.
   - **S**: Indicates that the word is a noun (substantive).

2. **mat:Sm1**:
   - **mat**: The lemma or base form of the word.
   - **S**: Indicates that the word is a noun (substantive).
   - **m1**: Indicates the gender and animacy of the noun. In this case, "m1" typically refers to a masculine personal noun.

These tags help in understanding the grammatical properties of the words generated by Morfeusz. Here's a brief explanation of some common tags:

- **S**: Noun (substantive).
- **m1**: Masculine personal.
- **m2**: Masculine animate (non-personal).
- **m3**: Masculine inanimate.
- **f**: Feminine.
- **n**: Neuter.

If you have more specific tags or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Oh interesting, thanks. So I think I may have misinterpreted the structure of the Morfeusz output... So, for instance, if I call the analyse function from the C module directly with "on" as its argument, I get the following result:
```python
[
        (0, 1, ('on', 'on:A', 'adj:sg:acc:m3:pos', [], ['daw.'])),
        (0, 1, ('on', 'on:A', 'adj:sg:nom.voc:m1.m2.m3:pos', [], ['daw.'])),
        (0, 1, ('on', 'on:S', 'ppron3:sg:nom:m1.m2.m3:ter:akc.nakc:praep.npraep', [], [])),
]
```

So, each result is a tuple which contains two numbers followed by a tuple of five elements. I don't know what the numbers represent, but the inner tuple is an analysis result, but I don't know exactly what each element represents. Can you figure it out?

GitHub Copilot: Sure! Let's break down the structure of the output from Morfeusz's [`analyse`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fjanusz%2Fgit%2Fduo-scrapo%2Fsrc%2Fduo_scrapo%2Fannotate.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A212%2C%22character%22%3A25%7D%7D%5D%2C%222c1f19c4-7f75-4f7c-acd0-eddb0ec59573%22%5D "Go to definition") function. Each result is a tuple containing two numbers followed by a tuple of five elements. Here's what each part represents:

1. **The two numbers**: These typically represent the start and end positions of the analyzed segment within the input text. They indicate the span of the text that the analysis result pertains to.

2. **The inner tuple of five elements**:
   - **First element**: The surface form of the word (the word as it appears in the text).
   - **Second element**: The lemma or base form of the word.
   - **Third element**: The morphological tags that describe the grammatical properties of the word.
   - **Fourth element**: Additional morphological information (often empty).
   - **Fifth element**: Additional annotations or comments (e.g., historical usage, dialectal forms).

Given this structure, let's update your code to handle and print these elements more clearly.

### Updated Code

# Generated by Copilot

from collections.abc import Iterable, Sequence
from typing import Literal, Self, Protocol
from attrs import define, field
from morfeusz2 import Morfeusz
import json
from pathlib import Path
import cattrs

morfeusz = Morfeusz()
roots: list[str] = []
for vocab_word in data:
    analysis = morfeusz.analyse(vocab_word.word)
    for start, end, (surface, lemma, tags, additional_info, annotations) in analysis:
        if ":" in lemma:
            print(f"Word: {surface}")
            print(f"Lemma: {lemma}")
            print(f"Tags: {tags}")
            print(f"Additional Info: {additional_info}")
            print(f"Annotations: {annotations}")
            print("(")
            for b in analysis:
                print(f"\t{b},")
            print(")")
```

### Explanation

1. **Updated the loop**: The loop now unpacks the analysis results into `start`, `end`, and the inner tuple `(surface, lemma, tags, additional_info, annotations)`.
2. **Print statements**: Added print statements to display each element of the analysis result clearly.

This should help you better understand the structure of the Morfeusz output and how to work with it in your code. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Wonderful, thanks for the help! So, I guess I need to parse the tags from the lemma as well. The only problem is I don't know what all the possible tags or or what they all mean. You've helpfully covered a few of them for me so far, but are you able to put together an exhaustive list of all the possible tags? If not, do you know where I can find such a list?

GitHub Copilot: Unfortunately, I can't provide an exhaustive list of all possible tags used by Morfeusz, as it is a comprehensive morphological analyzer for Polish and the tags can be quite extensive. However, I can guide you on where to find such a list and provide some common tags.

### Common Tags

Here are some common tags you might encounter:

- **Parts of Speech**:
  - **subst**: Noun (substantive)

These resources should provide detailed information about the tags used by Morfeusz and their meanings.

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Ahh, so maybe the elements I'm referring to aren't strictly "tags" then. Specifically, I'm looking for a glossary of all of the elements appearing after the lemma such as "S", "A", "Sm2", etc.

GitHub Copilot: Got it! The elements appearing after the lemma in the Morfeusz output are indeed morphological tags that describe the grammatical properties of the word. Here's a more detailed glossary of these elements:

```

This should help you understand and parse the tags more effectively. For a complete list of tags, refer to the official Morfeusz documentation or the Polish National Corpus resources mentioned earlier. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

rzyns: Thanks, so then what about the the lemmas (lemmae?) "i:C", "i:I", and "i:T"? I'm assuming "C" is for "Conjunction", but what about the others?

GitHub Copilot: In the context of Morfeusz and Polish morphological analysis, the tags following the lemma indicate the part of speech and other grammatical properties. Here are the meanings of the specific tags you mentioned:

- **i:C**: Conjunction (spójnik)
- **i:I**: Interjection (wykrzyknik)
- **i:T**: Particle (partykuła)

These tags help in identifying the grammatical category of the word. Here's a brief explanation of each:

- **C (Conjunction)**: Used to connect clauses or sentences (e.g., "i" meaning "and").
- **I (Interjection)**: A word or phrase that expresses emotion or exclamation (e.g., "och" meaning "oh").
- **T (Particle)**: A word that does not fit into the standard parts of speech but serves a grammatical function (e.g., "nie" meaning "not").

### Updated Code with Comments

Let's update your code to include comments and handle these tags appropriately.

            for b in analysis:
                print(f"\t{b},")
            print("]")
```

### Explanation

1. **Conjunction (C)**: Used to connect clauses or sentences.
2. **Interjection (I)**: Expresses emotion or exclamation.
3. **Particle (T)**: Serves a grammatical function but does not fit into standard parts of speech.

This should help you better understand and parse the tags in the Morfeusz output. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
